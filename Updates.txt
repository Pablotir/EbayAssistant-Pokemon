For version 1.5:
Gave up on using SerpAPI for now since I can't find a suitable way of refining results and 
managing to get specific results for each card. In the meantime, I created the giant filter that 
I have right now and will be used moving forward. No clue how my own refine function works since 
half the time a capitalized version will work and half the time a random variation of said word
will work. TBD how that works one day. 

1.6+ goal:
Make sure I can actually pull results from pricecharting using previous methods and also be able
to make a dictionary.txt for the filter and find a way to create a delay key to monetize.

For version 1.6: 
I managed to finally update to v3 and also managed to ensure that a notification with the price
from pricecharting to load in said notification.

1.7 goal:
Ensure that we can just stay on the same tab without switching and replace the text on ebay to 
show current price and avg price, maybe show discount of it later.
Also ensure that the stupid notification only happens 1x after clicking it.

(Rest of logs in old copies since major changes in code were used)
Finished adding a way to have 2 tabs open the pricecharting links independently without the prices
synching. Solution was to have it generate seperate IDs.
Notifications are now gone and substituted with an inline price, color pending for injection
I also did add a seperate button for auctions since that had an issue where it turns out the clock
for the auction affects the price you see live. Thus, everything was moved to the BIN or bid button.

1.8 goal + Monetization plan:
I want to make sure it works upon loading the listing.
Should automatically scan and find which grade is the card and automatically adjust using switch
case table

Long term plan:
Refine searches even more with manual checks
Eventually solve the arceus issue

Monetization idea:
Just take donations and make it Free
Add a section thats paywalled in which it will search on ebay for the lowest price

The extension now works immediately when a listing link is opened rather than
waiting for me to open it.

I can now grab all the details about the card and then add them at the end if they are of a specialty such as first edition or 
a specific set name, this helps accurately grab the card more often. I should be adding more specialty card suffixes now or in the
near future. 
Issue rn is that it won't clean up the title for this ebay link:https://www.ebay.com/itm/204821475356?itmmeta=01J052YVSWXARTGHMXYR75ABJF&hash=item2fb04fb01c%3Ag%3AUzMAAOSwq3ZmO2A9&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAAwJdfn4OfZDEz1CWV0KLLaDN20M54S5JnGV%2F6%2FpOd2yPxhXUIpd4Qwj9q2GRvdj26VPmvGGVamebBM93kq5IG7IT4764yYjDzIHvfcIIdz1JBza2Va5SPgHPkTRfDfSz6Pr%2Baw44x%2FfNgGjmAhjlorG0rGXbFSDIexpYQdWX7U07ty3KwvwMiwm6U4ILax8xVxxxTNVTo9%2BnjfQjkoqZtZmc70fa2nQXYEwn2iLVRp%2B50WUjyl%2B25tabt1hGPxc83Yw%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR4q9-6KBZA&LH_BIN=1

Now on Version 1.9
I did some updates on filters and disabled the clickable icon because its no longer in use.

Improved filter by a large margin, also added a database of all current Pokemon - TBD whether or not used since I haven't added directly in code
